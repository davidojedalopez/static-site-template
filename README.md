# A simple template for an 11ty + Tailwind CSS site.

There's an even more simplified version in the `simple` branch. The template in the `main` branch has a few additions, structure, and plugins that I end up using almost every time.

Feel free to fork this repo to serve as the starting point of your project. You can deviate as much as you want from there.
